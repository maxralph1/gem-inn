## How to Install and Run the Gem-Inn Application Locally On Your Device

1. You must have Python3 downloaded and installed on your device. Follow the guidelines on the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. After installing Python3, download and install a text editor [(e.g. VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) if you do not have one.

---

Then go to your terminal and follow these steps:

3. cd (change directory) into the folder directory from your terminal and create a folder in your favorite directory on your computer manually or you may create one from there using the following commands like below;

```
cd C:\Users\maxim\Desktop>
```

Here I changed directory into my personal Desktop space on my windows Computer. And then;

```
mkdir gem-inn
```

Or whatever you wish to call the application

4. cd into this newly created folder

```
cd gem-inn
```

and create a virtual environment

```
py -m venv venv
```

5. Activate the newly created virtual environment so that you can install Django and other dependencies.

```
source venv/Scripts/activate
```

You may decide to skip this step (step 5), to install and run Django from the system-wide installation. But virtual environments are always recommended.

6. Clone this repository from here on Github using either of the 2 commands on your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/maxralph1/gem-inn.git
```

or

```
git clone git@github.com:maxralph1/gem-inn.git
```

7. Use the command below to install all dependencies I utilized in this application as can be seen from my requirements.txt file

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

8. Now, cd into the geminn folder included from the cloned github repository and run the command below;

```
cd geminn
```

and

```
py manage.py runserver
```

## Contributor's Words !important

If you have any suggestions on how to improve this project, please share.
This application is strictly for demonstration purposes.

It is not yet production-ready and should never be used as such.

I have decided to put in my time into other projects as this isn't generating funds for me at the moment.

I will continue to gradually update this project in my free time, over a period of time (couple of months) until it is production-ready, while I handle other projects that would sustain my income.

However, if you would love to have this project completed urgently for your personal use, do not hesitate to contact me on: maxralph01@gmail.com.

\*\*On the general pattern of coding, if you noticed, the entire application has a specific approach in structure. I however decided to deviate (bring in several flavors) a little (but paid attention not to deviate too much) from these principles so as to showcase my skills.
I would stick to a particular pattern in a real-world application (N.B: my next e-commerce store before the end of 2023 would follow this strict pattern).

Finally, contributions/suggestions are welcome.
